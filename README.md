## Concept Overview

Traditional knowledge graph (KG) construction methods suffer from brittleness when dealing with noisy, unstructured inputs. This project introduces a **self-healing knowledge graph system** inspired by biological immune systems—an autonomous framework that detects and corrects anomalies in knowledge graphs without requiring perfect initial construction.

### Key Innovation: Biological Immune System Analogy

* **Anomaly Detection**: Like immune cells detecting pathogens, diagnostic agents identify incoherent relations and malformed entities
* **Adaptive Healing**: Similar to antibody response, correction mechanisms learn and evolve over time
* **Memory Formation**: System retains knowledge about past anomalies and successful repairs
* **Locality of Reference**: Operates relative to the current graph state rather than enforcing external ideal standards

## Research Problem

Current KG construction approaches face critical limitations:

* **Fragile Pipelines**: Non-ideal inputs (LLM outputs, casual text) create ambiguous entities like "elon and stacy" instead of discrete "Elon" and "Stacy"
* **Brittle Optimization**: Top-down methods assume ideal conditions and fail on real-world noisy data
* **Lack of Adaptability**: Systems cannot self-correct or evolve after initial construction

## Natural Emergence Philosophy

This system exhibits **natural emergence**—robust, scalable behavior arising from simple local rules rather than explicit top-down programming. Like ant colonies optimizing paths through local interactions, the self-healing KG achieves global coherence through distributed, adaptive corrections.

## Experimental Framework

### Experiment 1: DocRED SVO Healing *(Knowledge Graph Focus)*

**Objective**: Implement core self-healing mechanisms using DocRED dataset for document-level relation extraction.
**Approach**:

* Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triplet extraction and healing
* Anomaly detection in relation patterns
* Automated correction of malformed entities

**Location**: `experiments/exp1_docred_svo_healing/`

### Experiment 2: Generic Graph Healing *(Graph Type: Heterogeneous Graphs)*

**Objective**: Extend healing strategies to more general graphs beyond KGs.
**Approach**:

* Use open datasets with non-SVO structures (e.g., citation networks, social graphs)
* Test healing based on schema violations, connectivity issues, or structural anomalies
* Establish reusable FSM wrappers and modular logic for generalization

**Location**: `experiments/exp2_generic_graphs/`

### Experiment 3: DBLP Community Healing *(Graph Type: Citation Networks)*

**Objective**: Apply healing mechanisms to citation networks to improve community coherence.
**Approach**:

* Analyze community structures in the DBLP citation network
* Detect anomalies based on inter-community connections and node centrality
* Implement healing strategies to strengthen community boundaries

**Location**: `experiments/exp3_dblp_community_healing/`

### Experiment 4: Biological Network Healing *(Graph Type: Protein-Protein Interaction Networks)*

**Objective**: Apply healing mechanisms to biological networks to improve functional coherence.
**Approach**:

* Analyze protein-protein interaction networks
* Detect anomalies based on functional annotations and network topology
* Implement healing strategies to enhance module detection

**Location**: `experiments/exp4_biological_networks/` *(In progress)*

### Experiment 5: Knowledge Graph Temporal Healing *(Graph Type: Temporal Knowledge Graphs)*

**Objective**: Develop healing mechanisms for temporal knowledge graphs with evolving relationships.
**Approach**:

* Analyze temporal patterns in knowledge graph evolution
* Detect temporal anomalies and inconsistencies
* Implement healing strategies that respect causal constraints

**Location**: `experiments/exp5_temporal_kg_healing/` *(In progress)*

### Experiment 6: LiveJournal Influence Healing *(Graph Type: Social Networks)*

**Objective**: Detect and repair anomalies in social influence patterns within the LiveJournal network.
**Approach**:

* Identify influence anomalies using sentiment analysis and temporal patterns
* Apply healing mechanisms to correct unnatural influence relationships
* Evaluate impact on network coherence and sentiment flow

**Location**: `experiments/exp6_livejournal_influence_healing/`

### Experiment 7: Amazon Recommender Healing *(Graph Type: Co-Purchase Networks)*

**Objective**: Enhance recommendation quality by healing the Amazon co-purchase network.
**Approach**:

* Parse the co-purchase graph and community structure from product categories
* Detect anomalies including cross-community links, supernodes, and isolated products
* Apply healing strategies based on community reassignment and edge modifications
* Evaluate impact on recommendation coherence through triangle analysis

**Location**: `experiments/exp7_amazon_recommender/`

> *More experiments will follow for different graph types: time-evolving graphs, biological networks, etc.*
