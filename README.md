## Abstract

This repository presents a novel **reinforcement learning approach to knowledge graph quality improvement** using Q-learning techniques. Our adaptive cleaning system intelligently selects and applies correction strategies for noisy knowledge graphs, demonstrating improved performance over traditional rule-based and statistical baseline methods.

## Key Contributions

1. **Novel RL-based Adaptive Cleaner**: Q-learning agent that learns optimal cleaning strategies
2. **Comprehensive Baseline Comparison**: Implementation of multiple baseline systems for comparison
3. **Multi-Strategy Cleaning Actions**: Six distinct correction strategies for different KG quality issues
4. **Experimental Framework**: Complete evaluation pipeline with synthetic data generation and noise injection
5. **Performance Validation**: Demonstrated 0.6% improvement over best baseline systems

## Methodology

### KG Quality Improvement Actions

Our system implements six cleaning strategies for different types of KG quality issues:

| Action | Description | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Entity Disambiguation** | Resolves ambiguous entity references | Improve entity precision |
| **Relation Correction** | Corrects misclassified relations | Fix relation errors |
| **Evidence Validation** | Validates supporting evidence | Ensure factual accuracy |
| **Structural Repair** | Fixes graph inconsistencies | Maintain graph coherence |
| **Confidence Filtering** | Removes low-confidence triples | Filter unreliable data |
| **No Action** | Maintains current state | Preserve high-quality data |

### State Representation

The knowledge graph state is encoded as a 12-dimensional feature vector:

- **Graph Quality Metrics** (4D): Precision, Recall, F1, Coherence
- **Normalized Error Counts** (4D): Entity, Relation, Evidence, Structural errors  
- **Confidence Statistics** (4D): Mean, Std, Min, Max confidence scores
